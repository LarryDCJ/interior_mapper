// Watts is the unit of measure for power
// Power is the speed/rate at which electrical energy is transferred in a circuit.
// Watts is represented by "P" in equations.
watts = 1
// Ampere (amp) is the unit of measure for current.
// Current is the speed/rate that electrons flow through a conductor.
// Current is represented by the letter "I" (eye) in equations.
// SPEED THE WATER FLOWS THROUGH THE HOSE
amps = 1
// Ohms measure resistance in a conductor.
// Resistance tries to slow the flow of electrons. 
// Ohms are represented by "R" in electrical equations.
// HOW WIDE THE HOSE IS
ohms = 1
// Voltage (volts) is the unit of measure for electrical potential.
// This is the number of electrons between two points in a circuit.
// Voltage is represented by the letter "V" (vee) in equations.
// PRESSURE THAT PUSHES WATER THROUGH THE HOSE
var volts = 1
var I = amps
var R = ohms
// Voltage equals Current * Resistance
// Voltage equals amps    * ohms
var V = I * R
// Watts equals volts * current
var P = V * I
//////////////////////////////////////////////
// Voltage dictates the ultimate speed of the vehicle
// kV means RPM per Volt...
// kV/RPM = Volts
// kV/Volts = RPM
