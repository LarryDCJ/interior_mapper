This repo contains hardware instructions and software for lidar mapping using readily available parts.

In 2020, after moving into a new home with a dedicated office/workshop, I decided to start tinkering to see how far I could get using lidar to map a room. I eventually decided to try and do this autonomously using an RC car that bounces around until a room is fully mapped. I want to store this data in a database 

This idea evolved in an effort to work with many different software/hardware systems. 

I bought this RC Car based on the Tesla Cybertruck (made by Mattel).  I initially only wanted to take it apart to see if I could figure out why the connection between the truck and the provided controller was so unreliable. THe truck was extremely jerky and would stop responding after 3 minutes of that. After a reset, it would repeat this behavior.
